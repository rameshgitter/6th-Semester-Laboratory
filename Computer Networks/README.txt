Computer Network Laboratory README
Overview

This repository contains all assignments and work related to the Computer Network Laboratory. The lab uses the Linux (Ubuntu or Fedora) operating system to carry out various assignments, which require superuser permissions. You are encouraged to bring your own laptop to the laboratory for easier access to assignments.
Setup Instructions
Using a Linux Laptop (Ubuntu/Fedora)

    Bring your Linux laptop to the lab to complete your assignments. Make sure it is running Ubuntu or Fedora.
    If your laptop runs Windows or macOS, you can create a virtual machine using an Ubuntu image to perform the assignments.

Virtual Machine Setup (Windows/Mac)

If you're using a virtual machine (VM) with Ubuntu, follow these steps:

    Install your VM software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware).
    Download an Ubuntu image.
    Set the network mode of your VM to Bridge Mode (NOT NAT mode). This will help you understand the network-related tasks better and ease the completion of your assignments.

Superuser Permissions

Many assignments will require superuser permissions to proceed. Since you will have administrative access on your laptop, you can easily execute the required commands. If you do not have a laptop, you may use the department's computers.
Uploading Your Work

You are expected to regularly upload your code to the department server to ensure your work is backed up.

    Once you have completed an assignment, upload the implemented code to the department server.
    When an assignment is finished, submit the final version of your work in the classroom as per the instructions provided.
