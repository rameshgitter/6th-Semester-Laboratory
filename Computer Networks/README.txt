# Computer Network Laboratory

## Overview

This repository contains all assignments and related work for the **Computer Network Laboratory** course.  
All lab exercises are performed on Linux systems (**Ubuntu** or **Fedora**) and often require **superuser (root) permissions**.  
You are strongly encouraged to bring your own laptop for smoother access and convenience during the lab sessions.

## Setup Instructions

### Using a Linux Laptop (Ubuntu/Fedora)

- Bring your Linux laptop (**Ubuntu** or **Fedora** preferred) to the lab.
- Ensure your system is up-to-date and ready for development work.
- If your laptop runs **Windows** or **macOS**, set up a **virtual machine** (VM) with Ubuntu.

### Virtual Machine Setup (for Windows/macOS Users)

If you are using a VM, follow these steps:

1. Install virtualization software (e.g., **VirtualBox** or **VMware**).
2. Download and install an **Ubuntu** image.
3. Set the **Network Adapter** of your VM to **Bridge Mode** (not NAT mode).
   > âš¡ **Bridge Mode** allows your VM to act like a separate device on the network, which is important for network-related assignments.

### Superuser (Root) Permissions

- Many assignments require administrative privileges (i.e., `sudo` access).
- With your own laptop or VM, you will have full superuser rights.
- If you cannot bring your own device, departmental computers are available for use.

## Uploading and Submitting Your Work

- **Backup Regularly**: Upload your work frequently to the department server to ensure you don't lose any progress.
- **Final Submission**: After completing an assignment, submit the final version according to the classroom instructions.
