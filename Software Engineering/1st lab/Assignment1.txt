For each algorithm do the following

1. Implement the algorithm in any language of your choice

2. Generate tabular data of running time by varying the input size.

3. Plot the graph of running time from the tabular data.

4. Use your plot to justify theoretical time complexity.
   -> Best-case
   -> Average-case
   -> Worst-case
